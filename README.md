Sketch to search 3D retrieval system

1. Use Light field to extract 2D silhouettes from 3D models in several views

2. Map 2D silhouettes to 32x32 grids and compute shape histogram to describe the shape for each 3D model

3. Map sketch to 32x32 grids and compute similarities in the database

4. Apply quick sort and return 6 candidates models' indexes with high similarities
